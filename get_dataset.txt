To get the dataset 


https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

After downloading the dataset,folow the steps-

1. Create a folders in order 
        
                          dataset
                          /    \
                      train    test
                      /   \    /   \
                    ha    na  ha   na

2. Now according to metadata seperate the images as covid and non-covid
3. Now paste most of the covid images in dataset>train>ha and leftover(30) images in dataset>test>ha.
