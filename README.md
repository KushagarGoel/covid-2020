ML projects to help in adverse condition of covid-2020

This is the project that uses CNN to train the model to detect if the pnemonia is simple or is affected by corona virus.

This model is not very reliable for public use because it is trained just on 261 images and is tested on 41 images of lungs.

I got the accuracy of 92% in 25 epochs

loss: 0.1881 - accuracy: 0.9219 - val_loss: 0.7290 - val_accuracy: 0.7788
